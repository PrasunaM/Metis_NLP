# NLP Project Proposal

#### Question/need:
* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 

Change is inevitable and is happening all around us. Societal change is stimulated by media, human interactions, technology, and social environment. 
[TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks) is one such platform that enables expert speakers from all backgrounds to present their ideas that can influence a positive change in the society. My aim is to leverage the capabilities of NLP to understand what words or topics made a talk persuative and if are any relationships between each talk. Finally, I would like to build a linear regression model to predict the number of views.      


* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?



#### Data Description:
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? 
* If modeling, what will you predict as your target?

#### Tools:
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? 
* Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

#### MVP Goal:
* What would a [minimum viable product (MVP)](./mvp.md) look like for this project?
